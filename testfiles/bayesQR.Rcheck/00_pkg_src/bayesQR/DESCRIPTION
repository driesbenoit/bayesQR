Description: Bayesian quantile regression using the asymmetric Laplace distribution, both continuous as well as binary dependent variables are supported. The package consists of implementations of the methods of Yu & Moyeed (2001), Benoit & Van den Poel (2012) and Al-Hamzawi, Yu & Benoit (2012). To speed up the calculations, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo core of all algorithms is programmed in Fortran and called from R.
