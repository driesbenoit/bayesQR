# bayesQR: Bayesian Quantile Regression

Bayesian quantile regression using the asymmetric Laplace distribution, both continuous as well as binary dependent variables are supported.
The package consists of implementations of the methods of [Yu & Moyeed (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-7152(01)00124-9), [Benoit & Van den Poel (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.1216) and [Al-Hamzawi, Yu & Benoit (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1471082X1101200304).
To speed up the calculations, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo core of all algorithms is programmed in Fortran and called from R.
